That is, these circuits cannot be simply fully-defined by a number of qubits provided as input; this is the case of the UCCSD variational form, for example. However, one can still observe how different metrics scale for these circuits by varying problem size (e.g the molecule or basis set), which makes sense for users that are focused on concrete applications in the field."
